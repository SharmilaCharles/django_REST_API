    "**Purpose of `SearchFilter`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SearchFilter` class is a filter backend in DRF that allows clients to search through your API's list responses using query parameters. It dynamically filters a QuerySet based on a search query provided in the URL. This is particularly useful for APIs that need to provide a way to find specific resources based on text content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple Text-Based Search:** It enables basic text-based searching across one or more fields of a model.\n",
    "* **Query Parameter:** It typically uses a query parameter (defaulting to `search`) to take the search text as input.\n",
    "* **Customizable Search Fields:** You can specify the model fields that should be included in the search.\n",
    "* **Case-Insensitive:** By default, the search is case-insensitive.\n",
    "* **Backend Support:** It works with most database backends, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL.\n",
    "* **Integration with DRF:** It's easily integrated with your DRF views.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to implement `SearchFilter` in a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the `Book` model from our previous examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# models.py\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Book(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n",
    "    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    genre = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n",
    "    publication_year = models.IntegerField()\n",
    "    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "      return self.title\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Set up your View**\n",
    "\n",
    "In your DRF view, add `SearchFilter` to the `filter_backends` and specify the fields to search using `search_fields`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# views.py\n",
    "from rest_framework import generics\n",
    "from rest_framework.filters import SearchFilter\n",
    "from .models import Book\n",
    "from .serializers import BookSerializer\n",
    "\n",
    "class BookListView(generics.ListAPIView):\n",
    "    queryset = Book.objects.all()\n",
    "    serializer_class = BookSerializer\n",
    "    filter_backends = [SearchFilter]\n",
    "    search_fields = ['title', 'author', 'genre']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   We import `SearchFilter` from `rest_framework.filters`.\n",
    "*   We add `SearchFilter` to the `filter_backends` list, indicating that we want to use it in this view.\n",
    "*   We define the fields that `SearchFilter` will use for the search, in this example `title`, `author` and `genre`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can search your API using the default `search` query parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET /api/books/?search=war\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would return books which have the word `war` (case-insensitive) in either their `title`, `author`, or `genre` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET /api/books/?search=Tolstoy\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would return books which have the word `Tolstoy` (case-insensitive) in either their `title`, `author`, or `genre` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Default Search Parameter:** The default query parameter for `SearchFilter` is `search`. You can change this using the `search_param` attribute on your view set.\n",
    "*   **Multiple Search Terms:** Multiple search terms are treated as a logical OR. If you search for `war peace`, you will get all books which contain `war` *or* `peace` in their searchable fields.\n",
    "*   **Case-Insensitive:** The `SearchFilter` performs case-insensitive searches by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modifying the Search Behaviour**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specifying Search Fields**\n",
    "    * You can search based on relationship fields by using the double underscore notation e.g. `search_fields = ['title', 'author__name']`\n",
    "2. **Customizing Search Parameters**\n",
    "    * You can set the `search_param` variable in the view to modify the query parameter\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# views.py\n",
    "from rest_framework import generics\n",
    "from rest_framework.filters import SearchFilter\n",
    "from .models import Book\n",
    "from .serializers import BookSerializer\n",
    "\n",
    "class BookListView(generics.ListAPIView):\n",
    "    queryset = Book.objects.all()\n",
    "    serializer_class = BookSerializer\n",
    "    filter_backends = [SearchFilter]\n",
    "    search_fields = ['title', 'author', 'genre']\n",
    "    search_param = 'mysearch'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you can search by using `/api/books/?mysearch=tolstoy`\n"

    "\n",
    "3.  **Using Multiple Lookups**\n",
    "   By specifying multiple lookup expressions within your `search_fields`, you can control how the filter operates:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# views.py\n",
    "from rest_framework import generics\n",
    "from rest_framework.filters import SearchFilter\n",
    "from .models import Book\n",
    "from .serializers import BookSerializer\n",
    "\n",
    "class BookListView(generics.ListAPIView):\n",
    "    queryset = Book.objects.all()\n",
    "    serializer_class = BookSerializer\n",
    "    filter_backends = [SearchFilter]\n",
    "    search_fields = [\n",
    "        'title',\n",
    "        '=author', #exact match on author\n",
    "        '^genre', #starts with on genre\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now:\n",
    "   *  Searching by `/api/books/?search=war` will search the title field using case-insensitive `contains`\n",
    "   *  Searching by `/api/books/?search=tolstoy` will use an exact match on the author field.\n",
    "   *  Searching by `/api/books/?search=fic` will search the genre using case-insensitive `startswith`\n",
    "    * You can combine multiple different lookup expressions on your fields\n",
    "    * Supported Lookup Expressions\n",
    "        *   `^` Starts-with search.\n",
    "        *   `=` Exact match search\n",
    "        *   `@` Full-text search.\n",
    "        *   `$` Regex search.\n",
    "         * By default if no lookup expression is provided, a `contains` case-insensitive search is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Adding Search to an API**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a `Product` model with `name`, `description` and `category` fields. To allow users to search through products, you'd do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# models.py\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Product(models.Model):\n",
    "    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n",

    "    category = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "      return self.name\n",

    "    filter_backends = [SearchFilter]\n",
    "    search_fields = ['name', 'description', 'category']\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, clients can search products like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `GET /api/products/?search=laptop` (finds products with \"laptop\" in name, description, or category)\n",
    "*   `GET /api/products/?search=electronics` (finds products related to \"electronics\")\n",
    "*   `GET /api/products/?search=new` (finds products with \"new\" in name, description, or category)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use `SearchFilter`**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Basic Keyword Search:** You should use it when you need to implement text-based keyword search across your model fields.\n",
    "*   **User-Friendly Filtering:** It's very suitable when you want to give users a convenient way to filter through data based on a text input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Performance:** For larger tables, full text searches may not be performant. Consider using more specialized search solutions (like Elasticsearch or Solr) for better performance.\n",
    "*   **Security:** Be careful of allowing arbitrary regex searches with the `$` expression since malicious users could submit expensive search queries that may impact database performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "`SearchFilter` in DRF is a quick way to add search functionality to your APIs. It offers straightforward text-based filtering, customizability and flexibility by supporting custom lookup expressions and parameter names. By setting your view to use the `SearchFilter` and specifying your searchable fields, you can provide users with a convenient way to find data within your resources.\n"
